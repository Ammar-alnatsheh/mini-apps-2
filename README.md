# mini-apps-2

In this 4-day sprint, you will build four "mini apps" completely from scratch. Building small apps from scratch is something that you will be asked to do in every technical interview during your job search. Mastering these concepts is essential to landing a job.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you start from scratch on each challenge and that you DO NOT copy code from a previous challenges, even if some aspects of the next challenge appear to be similar. Why? Read on:

Expect to learn something new in each challenge: an interesting technique, an insight you didn't previously have or an 'aha' moment that connects dots. As you uncover these learnings, you might think 'I wish I knew this before I started'. Good news! That's exactly why we're asking you to start from scratch on each challenge. Applying knowledge in later challenges is one of best ways to retain that newfound knowledge.
Practice makes perfect. The more times you repeat doing the basics, the easier it will be to perform those basics in the future.
In addition to the above requirement, you should not copy or reference code and lecture materials from your prior sprints. Practice autonomy by finding answers on the internet.
